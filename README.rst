AIREO library

Description
===========

The initial version of the AIREO Python library  provides essential functionality for AIREO TDS creators and TDS users. These functionalities are grouped into three main categories:

* Functionality to help dataset creators create AIREO TDS which are FAIR, are of high quality and adhere to the AIREO specifications.
* Functionality to assist dataset users to perform high level exploratory data analysis on an AIREO TDS. The library will allow the users to explore the statistical properties of an AIREO TDS through the metadata stored within a TDS catalog, and will provide functionality for the users to visualise key aspects of the data.

* Functionality to help users load the data of an AIREO TDS and access it through common data formats used by the ML community (numpy arrays, xarray etc.) so that competent ML practitioners can use the data to train ML models using their chosen ML libraries and platforms with minimal effort.
